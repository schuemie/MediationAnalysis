  abstract = "Background: Propensity score adjustment is a popular approach for
              confounding control in observational studies. Reliable frameworks
              are needed to determine relative propensity score performance in
              large-scale studies, and to establish optimal propensity score
              model selection methods. Methods: We detail a propensity score
              evaluation framework that includes synthetic and real-world data
              experiments. Our synthetic experimental design extends the
              'plasmode' framework and simulates survival data under known
              effect sizes, and our real-world experiments use a set of
              negative control outcomes with presumed null effect sizes. In
              reproductions of two published cohort studies, we compare two
              propensity score estimation methods that contrast in their model
              selection approach: L1-regularized regression that conducts a
              penalized likelihood regression, and the 'high-dimensional
              propensity score' (hdPS) that employs a univariate covariate
              screen. We evaluate methods on a range of outcome-dependent and
              outcome-independent metrics. Results: L1-regularization
              propensity score methods achieve superior model fit, covariate
              balance and negative control bias reduction compared with the
              hdPS. Simulation results are mixed and fluctuate with simulation
              parameters, revealing a limitation of simulation under the
              proportional hazards framework. Including regularization with the
              hdPS reduces commonly reported non-convergence issues but has
              little effect on propensity score performance. Conclusions:
              L1-regularization incorporates all covariates simultaneously into
              the propensity score model and offers propensity score
              performance superior to the hdPS marginal screen.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Among the large number of cohort studies that employ
               propensity score matching, most match patients 1:1. Increasing
               the matching ratio is thought to improve precision but may come
               with a trade-off with respect to bias. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate
               several methods of propensity score matching in cohort studies
               through simulation and empirical analyses. METHODS: We simulated
               cohorts of 20,000 patients with exposure prevalence of
               10\%-50\%. We simulated five dichotomous and five continuous
               confounders. We estimated propensity scores and matched using
               digit-based greedy (``greedy''), pairwise nearest neighbor
               within a caliper (``nearest neighbor''), and a nearest neighbor
               approach that sought to balance the scores of the comparison
               patient above and below that of the treated patient (``balanced
               nearest neighbor''). We matched at both fixed and variable
               matching ratios and also evaluated sequential and parallel
               schemes for the order of formation of 1:n match groups. We then
               applied this same approach to two cohorts of patients drawn from
               administrative claims data. RESULTS: Increasing the match ratio
               beyond 1:1 generally resulted in somewhat higher bias. It also
               resulted in lower variance with variable ratio matching but
               higher variance with fixed. The parallel approach generally
               resulted in higher mean squared error but lower bias than the
               sequential approach. Variable ratio, parallel, balanced nearest
               neighbor matching generally yielded the lowest bias and mean
               squared error. CONCLUSIONS: 1:n matching can be used to increase
               precision in cohort studies. We recommend a variable ratio,
               parallel, balanced 1:n, nearest neighbor approach that increases
               precision over 1:1 matching at a small cost in bias.",
